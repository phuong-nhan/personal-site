      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Interview questions</h3>
      <p></p>

      <details>
        <summary style="color:#83CFD4;font-weight:700;font-size:1.1em;">Tell us about yourself</summary>
        <ul style="display: flex;

        font-size: 11px;">
        <li>
        I graduated as a graphic designer from NC. I was fortunate enough that I got to be one of the 10 international students that got the average of 95 out of 100 in my 3rd year and I received a scholarship from the college for that. </li>

        <li>About Graphic Design, I believe that it is my passion and a right career choice for me. I always take my work seriously and work hard on projects.</li>

        <li>So graduated, I got a position at Gibbys Electronic Supermarket. l took care of their website, ad banners, and print ads. Because the business is local and small, I got chances to do almost everything design related for them.</li>

        <li>For the last couple of months, after I left Gibbys, I went traveling a lot. I learn and grow while I’m traveling, I like to explore designs from different places, see how the billboards and advertisement are done in somewhere else. I went to Montreal this June and the street arts there are amazing.</li>

        <li>Now, I think I’m ready for the next journey, I want to look for a company that I can fit in, where my skills can be helpful to. Compared to the first time I applied for jobs, I am now more confident and I know what values I can bring to the company and what I am looking for in a position.
        </li>
      </ul>

      text-align: left;
      font-size: 11px;">
      <li>
      I choose graphic design because it aligns well with my passion in art and the potential that we all see in computer and technology.</li>

      <li>I discover my natural talent in art since I was young, I like doing handmade crafts, and decorating things. </li>

      <li>Before I got in graphic design, I actually thought of studying architecture. But the more I learn about graphic design, the greater my love for it.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>
    This is my fifth year using Adobe Creative Cloud Softwares such as Photoshop Illustrator InDesign.</li>

    <li>I also use Figma and XD for Web/UX/UI Design, been using them 4 years.</li>

    <li>For Motion Graphic, I use After Effects.
    For Video Editing, I use Premiere Pro on computers and Capcut on phone, cuz I do make Tiktok videos.</li>
    <li>And last but not least,  the software that I am so glad I started to use, it is the 3D software called Blender.</li>

  </ul>

  <summary style="color:#83CFD4;font-weight:700;font-size:1.1em;">Where do you get inspiration and stay up-to-date on the design trends or softwares?</summary>
  <ul style="display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  gap: 10px 0;
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 11px;">
  <div>I can list out a few:</div>
  <li>I actively use Instagram as a source of inspiration and trend exploration. I follow trendsetters and top designers in the industry to see what they are working on and what new techniques or softwares they are using</li>
  <li>I also use the automatic updates to ensure that I have the latest versions of design software, when the new features info will pop up and I make sure I read those thru.</li>
  <li>And then the RGD (the Graphic Designer Community) they have webinars, summits, I also join at least once a year.</li>
  <li>And a friend of my from college, we are still hanging out after graduated, we often have conversations about deigns, like new tools new plugins, and exchange knowledge and experiences.</li>
</ul>

  text-align: left;
  font-size: 11px;">
  <div>
  There are some reasons why I chose to leave.</div>

  <li>The first one, the one I need but they don’t have, is a professional environment. What I mean by that is an environment where there are daily or weekly meetings, there are more collaborations between teams, or betwwen leaders andmembers. 
  I want to receive guidance and learn from leaders. I know working independently is important but I am still new to the industry, I do really need feedbacks cuz that's a way to get better.</li>

  <li>Another thing is with Gibbys, they focus on releasing flyers a lot so I had to spend many time doing flyers, but the process and the design are almost the same, so I felt like my design skills stayed the same, and I am not happy with the fact that I didn’t improve much.</li>

</ul>

  <li>
  OMG, this is a common question but I hesitate about my answer the most. Not because I don't have any goals or I don't plan for my future but the technology is changing so fast. like AI are being used a lot nowadays. I think for visual arts & designers, it's so hard to predict the future. I guess designers like us will find a way around to still pursue this career with the support of AI, and I have to do my best to keep up with the changes.</li>

  <li>Hopefully I can gain the title of a Senior Graphic Designer within 5 years.</li>

  <li>I hope I can generate many more 3D models in my free time, it will be cool if I can design for Starbucks, Ikea. Idk I have been having ideas about that.</li>

  <li>And I would like to earn a higher degree like bachelor or master in a near future before I turn 30.</li>

</ul>

<details>
  <summary style="color:#83CFD4;font-weight:700;font-size:1.1em;">Strengths? Weaknesses?</summary>
  <ul style="display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  gap: 10px 0;
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 11px;">
  <li>
  Strength: I think I have a strong sense of visual communication, like if I come across a content on social media, for example: you know the reels where people use tips and tricks about filming and effects to create very cool reels..yeah my ideas about how they did it or how I can create something in my way but similar to it, these ideas come real fast after I watch the videos.</li> 

  <li>Haha I was surprise that the first tiktok video I did about my cat, it went way more viral than I expected, I got like 300 thousand views and 17 thousand likes on Instagram I think.</li>

  <li>Weakness: I wanna say that I am shy and quite sometimes. It is because of the fact that I'm not knowing the cuture, the people enough, I feel like, I mean the Canadian culture. It is not like anyone judges me or does something not nice, but it's just the feeling of an immigrant who was born and have spent 20 years in another totally different culture. So I can be insecure and not confident sometimes, I know I should not be sad or anything. But you know, it's hard to get a 100% no culture shock at all.</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="color:#83CFD4;font-weight:700;font-size:1.1em;">How do you handle deadlines?</summary>
  <ul style="display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  gap: 10px 0;
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 11px;">
  <li>
  I always use Google Calendar to organize my deadlines and tasks.</li> 

  <li><div>When dealing with tight deadlines, I have to sit down, look at my calendar carefully.</div>
    <div>I would make suitable adjustments, reconsider and prioritize tasks, eliminate non-essential tasks.</div>
  </li>

  <li><div>One of the important thing as well is when we are in rush, we tend to forget things, so I always make sure I am more speficfic with what needs to be submitted, I break down the big task into smaller tasks.</div>
    <div>And put a check mark next to them so that I stick to the plan on a daily basis.</div>
  </li>

  <li>
  And depends on the projects, in some cases, if I already tried my best but it doesn't work out, I will reach out to clients or the my manager to see if they can extend the deadlines cuz I want to maintain the quality of the final product.</li> 

</ul>

  text-align: left;
  font-size: 11px;">
  <li>In these circumstances, I would do research and gather as much infomation as possible from the available resources, could be from the internet or from the team. After that, I'd discuss and clarify again with the clients or the team, make sure I prepare some questions to narrow down the objectives, the target audience and what not.</li>

  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-evenly;

  text-align: left;
  font-size: 11px;">
  <li>I would like to share an experience about a project I participated on in college. The project was for the whole graduation event of all the graphic design students of that year.</li>
  <li>The main problem occurred at the first phase where we had to choose the theme and concept of the event. My idea for the concept was conflicted with the idea of another person. And many of the students follow his idea since it’s simpler to design, they don’t want to spend time for the event since it doesn’t affect their grade. 
    As a calm person myself, I prefer to listen carefully to everyone’s input, and then consider thoughtfully. I sought guidance from my professor, and dedicated time trying out different ways to combine his idea and mine together.
  I ,then, organized my idea and prepared the talk to persuade the project managing team. </li> 
  <li>The approach of mine made everyone agree and decide to change the theme. Even now, after graduated for more than 2 years, we looked back and are still happy with the design we chose.</li>

  <div>Can I say about a couple, I will try to be short?</div>
  <li>First of all is my personal website, my personal branding. I know many designers don't even have their personal websites or they just build a very simple one. But I take my personal website as a very serious project, and thanks to that, I got a quite number of clients and recruiters reach out to me.</li> 
  <li>The 2nd and the 3rd ones are the 2 meaningful organizations I did during college. 1 is Ontario Wildlife Rescue and the 2nd is Ontario College Student Community. Both of them has great value to the society. Like the second one I did during COVID while students were all stuck at home doing online classes, I made that platform as a place for them to get as many supports as pssible, and enlightening their online experiences with chat forums and voucher system.</li>
  <li>I currently made some 3D models that I am proud of too.</li>

  <li>May I ask if the company can sponsor employees to attend professional events? </li> 
  <li>I asked that because there is an annual event that I really want to attend as an employee of a company. So In Canada, there is a Design Conference which is held yearly by RGD, usually in Toronto. There are going to be presentations from lead designers. It is a great opportunies for designers from everywhere in Canada to meet and share knowledge and experience, to expand the connections, also for businesses to prove that they care about visual communication of their company, and care about their designer employees.</li>
  <li>
    <div>In general, I just think it is such a special occassion and designers and marketers must join.</div>
    <div>So if possible, even if I am not going to be an employee at your company, I would suggest the company to sponsor the new person to go.</div>
  </li>

  font-size: 11px;">
  <div>I do have 1 thing that I want to be transparent with you right now so that it's better for you to determine later. So I am a temporary resident, currently under a 3 year work permit in Canada. And since I already graduated and have been on the permit for 2 years, I only have 1 year left. So if the company decides to hire me, I will appreciate that opportunity a lot and of course I want to be employed for a long period of time, however, for my to be able to stay here and continue to work for you as a permanent employee, the IRCC will need the LMIA letter from the company to provide me a permanent status in Canada. Have you heard about the LMIA before?</div>
  <div>LMIA stands for Labour Market Impact Assessment. Basically a paper to confirm with IRCC that the company selects me and wants to keep me rather than letting me work for a year and then leave. There will be a law firm or an agent needed to do this paper and a cost that the company has to submit for IRCC to process the application, approximately $1000. And I am fine if the company wants to deduct this amount from my paycheck. </div>
